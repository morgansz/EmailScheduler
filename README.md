# EmailScheduler
This project is a sophisticated email scheduling system developed in Python. It allows users to create and manage scheduled emails, ensuring timely communication without manual intervention.
# Structure
The application architecture is structured around several key Python files, each fulfilling a specific role:

config.py: Houses configuration details such as email credentials, SMTP server specifics, and database connection parameters.
models.py: Establishes the data model for the Email object, encompassing the recipient's email address, subject, body, and scheduled dispatch time.
email_sender.py: Manages the task of sending emails leveraging the SMTP protocol. This module utilizes the configuration details from config.py.
scheduler.py: Incorporates the scheduling logic to dispatch emails at the planned time, utilizing the APScheduler library for task scheduling.
main.py: Serves as the application's entry point, initializing the scheduler and launching the application.
# Core Features
Email Scheduling: Enables users to schedule emails for future dispatch, a capability provided by the scheduler.py and email_sender.py files.
Database Integration: Integrates with a database (defined in config.py) to store and retrieve scheduled emails. This functionality is implemented in the models.py file.
Automated Email Dispatch: Automatically sends emails at the scheduled time, utilizing SMTP server details from config.py.
