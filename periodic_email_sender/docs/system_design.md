## Implementation approach:
For the implementation approach, we will use the following open-source tools:

1. Flask: A micro web framework for building web applications in Python.
2. APScheduler: A task scheduling library for Python that allows us to schedule emails at specific times.
3. Flask-Mail: An extension for Flask that provides email sending capabilities.
4. SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

We will use Flask to create a web application that allows users to input the necessary information to send emails. APScheduler will be used to schedule the emails at specific times. Flask-Mail will handle the email sending functionality. SQLAlchemy will be used for managing the database of email recipients.

## Python package name:
```python
"periodic_email_sender"
```

## File list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "scheduler.py",
    "email_sender.py",
    "config.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User{
        +int id
        +string email
        +string password
        +string name
        +List[Email] emails
    }
    class Email{
        +int id
        +string subject
        +string body
        +datetime scheduled_time
        +bool sent
        +List[Recipient] recipients
    }
    class Recipient{
        +int id
        +string email
        +int email_id
    }
    class EmailSender{
        +send_email(Email email) -> bool
    }
    class Scheduler{
        +schedule_email(Email email) -> bool
    }
    class Database{
        +add_user(User user) -> None
        +get_user_by_email(string email) -> User
        +add_email(Email email) -> None
        +get_emails_by_user(User user) -> List[Email]
        +add_recipient(Recipient recipient) -> None
        +get_recipients_by_email(Email email) -> List[Recipient]
    }
    User "1" -- "many" Email: has
    Email "1" -- "many" Recipient: has
    EmailSender "1" -- "1" Email: sends
    Scheduler "1" -- "1" Email: schedules
    Database "1" -- "many" User: has
    Database "1" -- "many" Email: has
    Database "1" -- "many" Recipient: has
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as U
    participant Main as M
    participant EmailSender as ES
    participant Scheduler as S
    participant Database as DB
    U->>M: Input email details
    M->>ES: send_email(email)
    ES->>S: schedule_email(email)
    S->>DB: add_email(email)
    S->>DB: add_recipient(recipient)
    S->>S: Check if email should be sent now
    S->>ES: send_email(email)
    ES->>DB: Update email sent status
    DB-->>S: Return email sent status
    S-->>ES: Return email sent status
    ES-->>M: Return email sent status
    M-->>U: Display confirmation message
```
